# Digit-Recognition
This is part of Kaggle Digit Recognition Challenge. It performs task to recognize a digit from a given image.It has been classified using 2 approaches:

1) KNN based approach:
  Found its nearest neighbours and then predicted by taking the majority vote among its neighbours.
  
2)  Convolutional Neural Network:
  It has been implemented using 3 layer deep convolutional neural network. Accuracy around 99% is obtained using this approach.
